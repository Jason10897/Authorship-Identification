# FinalYearProject
Contains the code and datasets for my final year project titled 'Authorship Identification'. This project uses the concepts of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to create a system that can predict the author of an anonymous text from a given set of individuals by using their writing style features. It also contains a research paper published by my team on this project.
