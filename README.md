# Final-Year-Project
Contains the code and datasets for my final year project titled 'Authorship Identification'. It also contains a research paper published by my team on this project. This project uses the concepts of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to create a system that can predict the author of an anonymous text from a given set of individuals by using their writing style features. We tested different approaches to solve the problem at hand and selected a method that was previously unexplored. It gives good performance with low computational cost and an accuracy of approximately 86.95%.
